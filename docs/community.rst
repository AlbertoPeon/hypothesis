Community
=========

The Hypothesis community is small for the moment but is full of excellent people (and me)
who can answer your questions and help you out. Please do join us.

The two major places for community discussion are:

* `the mailing list <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/hypothesis-users>`_.
* An IRC channel: #hypothesis on freenode.

Feel free to use these to ask for help, provide feedback, or discuss anything remotely
Hypothesis related at all.

The IRC channel is the more active of the two.
Even if you don't know how to use IRC, you can use IRCCloud to access it. Just click `this link to join #hypothesis <https://www.irccloud.com/#!/chat.freenode.net:6667/%23hypothesis>`_.
You'll be taken through the IRCCloud sign up flow, after which you will find yourself in the IRC channel. Say hi.

(IRCCloud is made by friends of mine, but that's not why I'm recommending it. I'm
recommending it because it's great).

Code of conduct
---------------

Note that everyone in these spaces is expected to abide by a code of conduct, the `Hacker School social rules <https://www.hackerschool.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules>`_.
This is an inclusive environment for people from a variety of backgrounds and skill levels. Prejudice and aggression are unwelcome and everyone should be treated with respect.

I'll do my best to pay attention to peoples' behaviour, but if you see anyone violating these rules and I haven't noticed, please alert me and I'll deal with it. Usually I will simply ask people to modify their behaviour,
but for particularly severe transgressions, repeat offenders or those unwilling to change their ways I'll ban them from the community.
